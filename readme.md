## Features (MVP):
    adding your tasks (displaying number of tasks);
    deleting your tasks (through button);
    searching tasks that are already added;

## When MVP is done:
    do RWD with some nice styling

## Maybes:
    marking if task is completed (set as not done when added task);
    set your tasks as init when reload/revisit website;
    use cookies/json;
    button to delete all tasks;

#Ideas:
    searchbar try to do as popup, rest of page blurred
